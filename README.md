This repository demonstrates a common React Native error: attempting to access a property of an undefined or null object.  The `bug.js` file shows the error in action, while `bugSolution.js` provides a robust solution using optional chaining and nullish coalescing.  This example highlights the importance of defensive programming when working with asynchronous data or nested objects in React Native. The bug occurs when trying to render data before it's fully fetched or when dealing with potentially missing data structures.  Understanding and applying the fixes described here can significantly improve the stability and reliability of your React Native applications.
