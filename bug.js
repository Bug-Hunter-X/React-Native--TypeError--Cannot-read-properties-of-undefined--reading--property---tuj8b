This error occurs when you try to access a property of an object that is null or undefined.  This commonly happens when fetching data asynchronously and trying to render it before it's available.  For instance, if you have a component that displays user data fetched from an API, and you access `user.name` before the API call completes, you'll get this error. Another common scenario is when you are working with nested objects and one of the parent objects is null or undefined.
